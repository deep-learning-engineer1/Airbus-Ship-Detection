# Airbus-Ship-Detection
This model has arhitecture U-Net. Which is used for segmentation and works on encoder and decoder.
First of all, I need to explore and prepare data, what I did in "Exploratory_data_exported_from_Jupyter_Notebook". In this file I opened all images and CSV file with coordinates for bounding boxes. After that I draw bounding boxes on images. When I annoted all images, I was ready to start training model.
I created official U-Net model and well-trained it. For this model we use neurons: Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, TransposeConv2D. The most interesting layer from this list is "TransposeConv2D", this is opposite to Conv2D, we used this type of neurons in decoder part. Code for model in gihub file "model_training.py". I was ready to code model_inference in file "model_inference".
